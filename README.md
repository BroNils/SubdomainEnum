# Privacy Policy
Please note that, this program "SubdomainEnumeration" was created to make it easier for you to find a subdomain of a site. And I did not insert any virus in this program, for proof please look at [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/542416124e1741db44be6b1720f617665afed0552bb6dda72f6889e52ef14cca/detection). The result of viruto scan is not 100% right, like they said "some engines detected this file" which might not be true. It can be claimed as a virus just because it encrypted, and why i encrypt this file is because for protecting the source from any rewriting action.
