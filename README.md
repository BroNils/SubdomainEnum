# Privacy Policy
Please note that, this program "SubdomainEnumeration" was created to make it easier for you to find a subdomain of a site. And I did not insert any virus in this program, for proof please look at [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6195a7148706fd02dc52ec56cae71a75608804250171f3028085cf1a036e80e7/detection). The result of viruto scan is not 100% right, like they said "some engines detected this file" which might not be true. It can be claimed as a virus just because it encrypted, and why i encrypt this file is because for protecting the source from any rewriting action.

# Disclaimer
I do not responsible for any activities carried out using this program.

# FYI
Sometimes i forgot to change the binary information (e.g File version: 2.6.0.0), and i'm sorry for that
